Compiling Instructions:

- A typescript has been included that shows project compiling and how
  it was compiled.
- Otherwise, all the .h and .cpp files should be compiled together
  and be in the same folder, along with the .txt files required for
  the project (data4customers.txt, data4movies.txt, data4commands.txt)
